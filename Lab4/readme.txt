Now that you have seen how powerful the decorator design pattern is you will use it to model a car
dealership. You can pick your own but if you want a suggestion go to http://www.chevrolet.com/
and select a vehicle of your choice. Look for one that you are able to build and price through their
web interface. Your job is to model this same procedure using the decorator pattern. If you have a
set of options that are over 5 (ex: Mechanical options), just present 5 options. As you decorate the
vehicle with various options indicate the description of options as well as the cost of the vehicle.
Your design should allow the possibility to decorate a vehicle with any combination of the available
options. There is no need to have a user interface. You may use test code to stimulate your design.
Have your test code decorate various combinations to test the functionality. Document your design
with a UML Class diagram
