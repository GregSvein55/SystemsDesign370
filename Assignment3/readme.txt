In this assignment, you will refactor a given Java program (optimizations.tar.gz) by choosing
appropriately from the refactoring catalogue available at https://refactoring.com/catalog/.

You are to meet the following requirements:
 A minimum of 5 refactoring operations must be performed.
 The refactoring operations must preserve the program’s functionality.

For each refactoring operation, you must insert comments to
- Give the refactoring operation a number,
- describe what refactoring operation was performed,
- give the rationale for your choice of the refactoring operation you have applied, and
- put the original code (i.e. before refactoring) inside the comments
The End
