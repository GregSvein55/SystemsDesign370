You have a postion testing and developing code for the online game World of Tanks. Your recent
work with the Factory Design Pattern has given you an idea on how to modify some development
and testing code. Your job is to test the algorithm for receiving damage. The basic idea is the
penetration value must exceed the armor value in order to cause damage. One alogorithm is posted
below but feel free to build your own. Make use of the Factory Design Pattern. This will allow your
test code to test the damage algorithm on any type of tank that has been created (as long as the 
algorithm does not change). Ideally you should be able to test an unlimited number of tanks and 
your test code will not change as new tanks are created and need to be tested.

Deliverables
• Create a factory capable of building 5 different tanks. (Of course this could grow)
• The test code (client ) should request all the different tanks to be built and then tested.
• The test code should not have to change as new tanks come online.
• Document your design by creating a UML Class Diagram.
• Submit your code and UML documentation to URCourses.
